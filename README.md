## Abstract

### Ecosystem

Back-end: this repo  
Front-end: https://github.com/securify-hackaton/front  
Mock websites: https://github.com/securify-hackaton/mock

### Overview

Securify is a mobile authentication application. It was built in 3 days and won the first place (out of 80 projects) during the 2018 [EPSI Engineering school](http://www.epsi.fr/) hackaton.  
  
Websites can add a "Connect with Securify" button to let their users login with Securify as they would with Google or Facebook.  

Users can allow or deny logins in the Securify mobile app, using their password or facial recognition, and chose what personal data they allow the website to use.
They can then review the allowed connections and revoke them at any time:

### What Securify can do for end users

- ability to chose what personal data 3rd party websites can access
- 1 password for every website
- centralised identity
- easily revoke an access

### And for website developers
- let Securify handle authentication for you
- let Securify manage RGPD compliance and user data for you
- simplify user experience

### Use cases

- I have a Netflix account I want to use on a friend's PC, but don't want to give him my password.
- I want to login into my bank account on a public PC but do not want to type in my password.
- I am using my social media account on someone else's device and want to be able to disconnect remotely, from my mobile phone.
- I want to only remember 1 strong password and still have strong security than having a different password for every website.
- I don't want to use passwords at all and I'd rather unlock websites with facial recognition (working perfectly) or fingerprints (needs to be implemented)

## Tech stack

### Back-end
We chose to use Node.js with TypeScript to speed up the development and have a rapidly working yet robust prototype.
User data is stored in a MongoDB database, images for facial recognition are stored in AWS S3 (inages metadata in Mongo, binary data in S3) and uses Microsoft Azure Face API to verify face matching.
Authentication is secured with JWT tokens, both between the mobile app and Securify's servers, and between 3rd party websites and Securify's servers. Each token has a scope of data it can use (email address, age, real name, nationality...) and can be revoked at any time.
Using socket.io allowed us to keep open a socket connection, and to log users in without needing them to refresh their page.
We used the gmail API with a freshly created gmail account to send email address verification emails. While this allowed us to be able to send mails quickly and easily, this would have to be changed for production.
Database (MongoDB) hosted on Atlas, server hosted on Heroku.

### Mock websites
Vue.js, CSS, Node.js+TypeScript, socket.io. Hosted on Heroku.

### Mobile app

## Workflow: authenticate by facial recognition

![auth workflow schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securify-hackaton/securify-back/master/readme-img/authentication-schema.jpg)

Left hand side: mock website (exemple here: Netflix).  
Middle: back-end.  
Right hand side: mobile app (front-end).  

(0) User clicks "Connect with Securify" and inputs his email address  
![user input his email address on Netflix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securify-hackaton/securify-back/master/readme-img/mock-netflix.png)

(1) POST query from Mock-Website-Frontend to Mock-Website-Backend
```
POST
{
    user email
}
```

(2) POST query from Mock-Website-Backend to Securify-Backend
```
POST
{
    mock website authentication key
    user email
}

returns
{
    authentication request ID
}
```

(2.5) Create an "authentication request" in the database  

(3) PUSH notification from Securify-Backend to the correct mobile (identified by user email address)
```
{
    company
    authentication request ID
}
```
![mobile notification: authentication request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securify-hackaton/securify-back/master/readme-img/notification.jpg)
Securify: Authentication request

(4) Display "Company X wants you to authenticate: Allow/Deny" on the mobile phone:
![netflix wants you to authenticate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securify-hackaton/securify-back/master/readme-img/netflix.jpg)

(4.5) If the user clicks allow, the mobile app will take a picture from the camera

(5) POST query from Securify-Frontend to Securify-Backend
```
POST
{
    allow: boolean
    picture
    authentication request ID
}
```

(5.5) Check with Azure Face API that the image matches

(6) POST query from Securify-Backend to Mock-Website-Backend, on the callback URL specified by the Mock Website.
```
POST
{
    allow: boolean
    authentication request ID
}
```

(7) Socket: allow or deny the authentication. If the user clicked "Allow" on the mobile app and the image matched, the user will now be authenticated with Netflix.

## Getting started

## Option 1: use our demo

### Step 1

Install Securify on your mobile phone:
- Android: search "Securify" on the Google Play Store
- iOS: not available yet, because it costs 90â‚¬/year to list an app
Create an account (with an email you will remember).

### Step 2

Netflic example: https://securify-netflic.herokuapp.com  
Spautify example: https://securify-spautify.herokuapp.com  
Epsy example: https://securify-epsy.herokuapp.com  

## Option 2: setup your own servers

Install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 

### Back end

Open a terminal in the `back` folder
```sh
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Setup the config
# Linux / MacOS (for Windows use SET instead of export)
export MONGODB_URI=[full uri with protocol, login, password and database]
export JWT_KEY=[secret]
export GMAIL_USERNAME=[address@gmail.com]
export GMAIL_PASSWORD=[password]
export DEPLOY_URL=http://localhost:3000
export AZURE_KEY=[Face API key]
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[AWS access key with a S3 scope]
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[secret]
export AWS_S3_IMG_BUCKET=securify

# Run the server
npm run start

# Create a dev account
# Name: full text name, e.g. "EPSI"
# Logo: image URL, e.g. "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1024649812988387328/QWQbqff7_400x400.jpg"
# Callback URL: http://localhost:3001/callback
echo http://localhost:3000/sdk

# Don't close the tab, you will need the public and private key!
```

### Mobile app

- Follow the README at https://github.com/securify-hackaton/securify-front to run the app
- Install Expo on your mobile phone (iOS or Android) and scan the QR code

### Mock website

Open another terminal in the `mock` repo
```sh
